The Grove Water Level Sensor is a very accurate sensor that can be helpful in water level sensing applications. It is completely waterproof and uses capacitive pads to detect water levels up to 10cm.

We used capacitive pads on the PCB of the module and did conformal coating over the PCB to make the sensor protect against moisture, dust, chemicals and high temperatures. We believe that this technique will allow you to make accurate water level measurements (±5mm accuracy) easily.
